Hello there!
Welcome to Stretching VR!
In this simulation, I will guide you through a series of exercises
that are designed to stretch your lower and middle back.
Before we begin, please take note of your surrounding play space.
Make sure you have enough room to exercise and 
make sure the floor is clear.
We will be laying down on the floor for some of these exercises,
so check that your area is extra safe!
In addition, please be mindful of your Oculus Headset.
We wouldn't want to damage it.
Now, without further ado, let's begin!
Let's start by stretching our left side. Follow my movement.
Breathe in.
And out.
Slowly come up with your arms still raised. Right side now.
Breathe in.
And out.
Excellent, come up. Once more on the left side.
Breathe in.
And out.
Very good. Back to middle. Arms down.
We're about to enter pushup position. Remember to protect
your Oculus Quest headset.
Down we go! Place your knees on the ground and
keep your arms shoulder width apart.
Arch your back downward to go into the cat stretch.
Breathe in.
From here, arch your back upward to go into the camel stretch.
And out.
Again, go into the cat stretch.
Breathe in.
Back to camel.
And out.
Once more into cat.
Breathe in.
Back to camel.
And Out.
Straighten up, back to center.
Very good! Let's take a seat.
Here's your reminder to make sure you have enough space to move
and to protect your Oculus Quest headset.
Now slowly and carefully lie on your back.
Slowly raise your right knee, keep your back and head straight if you can
and slowly move it to your left side.
You'll feel it in your lower back.
Breathe in.
And out.
Slowly lift your right knee back up
And down. Other side.
Raise your left knee, keep your back and head straight
and slowly lower it to your right side.
Breathe in.
And out.
Slowly lift your left knee back up
And down.
Slowly sit back up. We're more than halfway done!
Take a little breather.
We're going to be bending downward and touching our toes,
so remember to protect your Oculus Quest headset.
Now let's bend forward. Try to touch your toes if you can!
You'll feel the stretch in your lower back.
Slowly reach out and touch your toes.
Breathe in.
And out.
Excellent, slowly sit back up.
Very good! Let's finish off with something familiar.
Slowly go back into our pushup position with your knees on the floor
and your hands at shoulder width like so.
Ready?
Arch downward for cat stretch.
Breathe in.
Arch upward for the camel stretch.
And out.
Back to cat.
Breathe in.
Now to camel.
And out.
Once more to cat.
Breathe in.
Last one, back to camel.
And out.
And back to center. Excellent job.
When ready, slowly stand back up on your feet.
That's all! Thank you for playing!
You may now remove the Oculus Quest Headset.
Bye bye!
