Hello there!
Welcome to Physical Therapy / Stretching VR!
In this simulation, I will guide you through a series of exercises
that are designed to stretch your lower and middle back.
Before we begin, please take note of your surrounding play space.
Make sure you have enough room to exercise and 
make sure the floor is clear.
We will be laying down on the floor for some of these exercises,
so check that your area is extra safe!
In addition, please be mindful of your Oculus Headset.
We wouldn't want to damage it.
Now, without further ado, let's begin!
Let's start by stretching our left side. Follow my movement.
Breathe in.
And out.
Slowly come up with your arms still raised. Right side now.
Breathe in.
And out.
Excellent, come up. Once more on the left side.
Breathe in.
And out.
Very good, back to middle. Arms down.
